___

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the occurrence of subclinical mastitis in cows. Subclinical mastitis is a prevalent and costly condition in dairy farming, characterized by inflammation of the mammary gland without visible signs of infection. Early detection of subclinical mastitis is crucial for timely treatment and prevention of its spread, leading to improved animal welfare, reduced economic losses, and enhanced milk quality.
